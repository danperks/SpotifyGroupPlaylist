For When You Need to Vote on "Absolute Bangers"

  Rather than just sending a list of songs you like to your whatsapp group chat, and just having people say "yeah i like that " or "no , really?" and then when a song you all liked is agreed upon you have to find the song and add it to a shared list between you for it to inevitably fall through the cracks; why not have something which can do it for you?
  
 
 Spotify Group Playlist is exactly that. 
 
 You each authroise your accounts through spotify , then one of you creates a group. You then give each member the group pin to login to this group , where they are able to submit a playlist of songs of their choice. Once the user logs in they can either submit a playlist(as above) , or they are able to vote on the songs by clicking their choice. Every vote in favour or against is recorded , and once the song has a vote from every member the spotify ouput playlist is updated to record this change if all members have voted in favour. 
 
 By logging into the service,each member automatically follows the output playlist for that group,where it is saved to the lead user's library.
